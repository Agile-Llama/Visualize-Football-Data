# The idea of this function is to get an indication of how much pressing was done in a given game.

#The defensive actions that I am using are the following four Opta defined events:

    # Tackles
    # Interceptions
    # Challenges (failed tackles)
    # Fouls

# The final formula is PPDA = Number of Passes made by Attacking Team / Number of Defensive Actions
# A smaller PPDA value signifies a greater level of defensive intensity, 
# as in essence, the defence has allowed a smaller ratio of uncontested passes to be made.
